Footwear refers to garments worn on the feet, which originally serves to purpose of protection against adversities of the environment, 
usually regarding ground textures and temperature. Footwear in the manner of shoes therefore primarily serves the purpose to ease the 
locomotion and prevent injuries. Secondly footwear can also be used for fashion and adornment as well as to indicate the status or rank 
of the person within a social structure. Socks and other hosiery are typically worn additionally between the feet and other footwear for 
further comfort and relief. Cultures have different customs regarding footwear. These include not using any in some situations, usually 
bearing a symbolic meaning. This can however also be imposed on specific individuals to place them at a practical disadvantage against 
shod people, if they are excluded from having footwear available or are prohibited from using any. This usually takes place in situations 
of captivity, such as imprisonment or slavery, where the groups are among other things distinctly divided by whether or whether not footwear 
is being worn. In these cases the use of footwear categorically indicates the exercise of power as against being devoid of footwear, 
evidently indicating inferiority.
